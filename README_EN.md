## What is AfroPython?
AfroPython is a programming workshop that aims to encourage the black population in technology areas, but it is not an exclusive event for this group.

AfroPython wants to be a remarkable initiative: for those who do and for those who participate. And we want only positive and happy marks, since the reasons that unite us are not so historically noble: the fact that we are 54% of the Brazilian population and our presence represents only 0.4% of Information Technology professionals in Brazil.

# I want to contribute, how to run the project?

The structure consists of running basic commands of a project, minifying, compiling and compressing files.

The files should be organized in the SRC folder or in the default content folder depending on how the project will be developed.

## Required softwares:

```
1 - Node.js
2 - NPM (included in the Node.js version for Windows)
```

## Instructions on how to use the project

1 - To download frontend dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

2 - To run the project in [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):

```
$ npm start

## Other NPM tasks

We created a [waffle](https://waffle.io/AfroPython/afropython-site) where we will store all the tasks that still need to be done on our site.

In our [Wiki](https://github.com/AfroPython/afropython-site/wiki) you will find a little of our history :D.
