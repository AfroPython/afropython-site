# What is AfroPython?

AfroPython is a programming workshop that aims to encourage the black population in technology areas, but it is not an exclusive event for this group.

AfroPython wants to be a remarkable initiative: for those who do and for those who participate. And we want only positive and happy marks, since the reasons that unite us are not so historically noble: the fact that we are 54% of the Brazilian population and our presence represents only 0.4% of Information Technology professionals in Brazil.
